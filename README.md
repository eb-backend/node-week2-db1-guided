# Introduction to Relational Databases, SQL and Knex

## Recap
We basically created our own model functions directly in the router file using SQL queries
We implemented all this with no call back functions, well maybe the catch function. We used async await. 

In this project we will cover the basics of `Structure Query Language (SQL)`, `Relational Databases`, and `Knex.js Queries`.
